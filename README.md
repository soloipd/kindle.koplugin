## Kindle Virtual Library for KOReader

A KOReader plugin that lets you browse and read your Kindle book library directly in KOReader. Your books appear in a **Kindle Library** folder in the file browser — just tap to read.

**[Download latest release](https://github.com/kaikozlov/kindle.koplugin/releases/latest)**

### Features

- **Virtual Library** — Browse your Kindle books from a dedicated folder in KOReader's file browser
- **Exact Reading State Sync** — Switch between KOReader and the native Kindle reader at the same text position, in either direction
- **Cached for Speed** — Books are prepared on first open and cached, so re-opening is instant

### Installation

1. Download the release for your device's architecture:

   | Architecture | Devices |
   | ------------ | ------- |
   | **armv7** | Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle Basic, Kindle Oasis, Kindle Scribe |

   > **Not sure?** armv7 covers all modern Kindle models.

2. Extract `kindle.koplugin` to your KOReader plugins directory:
   - Kindle: `/mnt/us/koreader/plugins/`
3. Restart KOReader

### Usage

**Opening a book:**
1. Open the file browser and tap **Kindle Library**
2. Browse your books and tap to read
3. The first open takes a moment while the book is prepared — after that, it opens instantly

**Syncing reading progress:**
1. Go to **Menu → Kindle Library → Sync reading state with Kindle** to enable
2. Under **Sync behavior**, enable automatic open/close sync and choose the
   FROM/TO Kindle rules for newer and older progress
3. Exact reading position syncs whether the book is opened from Kindle Library,
   KOReader Bookshelf, or History; cached Kindle EPUBs are mapped back to their
   native source book automatically

Automatic sync runs before opening and after closing a book. **Ask me** waits
for your answer at that lifecycle boundary, **Always sync** applies silently,
and **Never** leaves the destination unchanged. The plugin translates KOReader
XPointers to Kindle KFX coordinates, persists them through Kindle's ReaderSDK,
and reverse-translates the native last-page-read position when returning to
KOReader. The shelf percentage is updated only after the authoritative native
save succeeds.

### Compatibility

> Designed for Kindle devices running KOReader alongside stock firmware.

Book-key extraction normally uses the Kindle Java DRM SDK bundled with the
firmware. If that route fails and
[Satsuoni's `kfxdedrm` KUAL extension](https://github.com/Satsuoni/DeDRM_tools/tree/master/Other_Tools/KRFKeyExtractor/kindle_device)
is installed at `/mnt/us/extensions/kfxdedrm/`, the plugin can automatically
use its tested native `libYJSDK` extractor as a fallback. The external binaries
are optional and are not bundled with this plugin.
